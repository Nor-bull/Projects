# Project synchronization 2 directories from console
Synchronization must be one-way: after the synchronization content of the replica folder should be modified to exactly match content of the source folder;

Synchronization should be performed periodically;

File creation/copying/removal operations should be logged to a file and to the console output;

Folder paths, synchronization interval and log file path should be provided using the command line arguments;

It is undesirable to use third-party libraries that implement folder synchronization;

It is allowed (and recommended) to use external libraries implementing other well-known algorithms. For example, there is no point in implementing yet another function that calculates MD5 if you need it for the task â€“ it is perfectly acceptable to use a third-party (or built-in) library;
